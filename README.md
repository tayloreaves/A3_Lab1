This is an in-class lab for my Multimedia Authoring class at Fanshawe College.
This project will revolve around creating properties in each of the car objects from the carData.js file and writing JavaScript variables and functions to retrieve the data to populate the index.html.
Specifically, I will be working with three Mini car models. When I will select one model thumbnail, this one will be full opacity while the others will be faded.
